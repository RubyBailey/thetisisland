# Thetis Island Website — Editor Guide

> **Reading this file:** This guide lives in the project's GitHub repository, where it's rendered as a formatted page. View it at: https://github.com/JohnShillington/thetisisland/blob/main/docs/editor_guide.md — or open the raw `.md` file in any Markdown viewer (macOS Finder Quick Look works; so does any text editor).

A quick-start guide for editing content on thetisisland.net using the Decap CMS admin panel.

## Logging In

1. Go to **https://thetisisland.john-shillington.workers.dev/admin/**
2. Click **Login with GitHub**
3. Authorize the app when prompted (first time only)
4. You'll land on the content dashboard

You need a GitHub account with access to the JohnShillington/thetisisland repository. If you don't have access, ask John to add you as a collaborator.

## The Dashboard

The left sidebar shows these collections:

| CMS Collection | What it controls |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Community & Groups** | Organizations, clubs, and services listed on the Community & Groups page |
| **Our Services** | TIRRA-managed services (solid waste, trails, cemetery, etc.) |
| **Pages** | The main website pages — sorted by navigation order, not alphabetically |
| **Home Cards** | The six navigation cards on the home page (titles and descriptions) |
| **Ferry Schedule** | Ferry departure times for the snake schedule diagram |

Click any collection to see its entries. Click an entry to edit it.

## Editing an Organization

Each organization has these fields:

| Field | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | The organization's full name (shown as the card heading) |
| **Tagline** | One-line description shown on the card |
| **Description** | Optional longer description (reserved for future use) |
| **Website URL** | Full URL (https://example.com) or internal path (/about). Leave blank if none. |
| **Category** | Determines which section the card appears in: Organization, Club, Social Service, or Social & Exercise |
| **Tags** | Optional labels like "Official", "Emergency-Related", "Recreation" |
| **Featured** | Toggle on to pin this entry to the top of its category |

## Editing a Service

| Field | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Service name (e.g., "Solid Waste Management") |
| **Short Description** | Brief summary shown in listings |
| **Featured** | Toggle on to show this service first |
| **Full Description** | Detailed content with hours, location, etc. Written in Markdown. |

## Editing a Page

| Field | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | Page heading and browser tab title |
| **Meta Description** | The snippet shown in Google search results |
| **Nav Order** | Controls the display order in the CMS list. Lower numbers appear first. |
| **Content** | The page body, written in Markdown |

**Note:** Some pages have special elements (the fire danger banner on Emergency, webcam images on Ferry, the calendar embed) that are built into the page template. These don't appear in the editor — only the prose content is editable here. To change those elements, ask John.

You cannot create or delete pages — only edit the existing nine.

### Page ordering

Pages in the CMS are sorted by the **Nav Order** field, not alphabetically. The order matches the website navigation bar. If you need to rearrange pages, change their Nav Order numbers. You don't need to worry about gaps — only the relative order matters.

## Editing Home Cards

The six navigation cards on the home page are editable under the **Home Cards** collection. Each card has:

| Field | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | Card heading (e.g., "Ferry Info") |
| **Link** | URL path the card links to (e.g., `/ferry`) |
| **Description** | Brief text shown below the title |

You can reorder, add, or remove cards. Changes take effect after the site rebuilds.

## Editing the Ferry Schedule

The ferry schedule is under **Ferry Schedule** in the sidebar. It has two sailing lists (Sunday–Thursday and Friday) plus legend text and notes.

Each sailing is one trip. The ferry zigzags — sailings alternate direction automatically. For each sailing, enter the time at each terminal the ferry visits, or leave a terminal blank if the ferry skips it on that trip.

The **Flag** dropdown lets you mark special sailings:
- **Probable DC** — Dangerous cargo sailing (no passengers)
- **Possible DC** — May or may not accept passengers
- **Arrival Only** — Last run of the day

**Important:** After editing, check the deployed site to make sure the snake diagram looks correct. The visual layout depends on sailing order and which terminals are filled in.

When BC Ferries publishes a new schedule, update the **Effective Date** field and edit each sailing to match the new times. The official schedule is always at the [BC Ferries website](https://www.bcferries.com/routes-fares/schedules/seasonal/THT-CHM).

## Editor Notes

Many entries have a field labelled **"Editor Notes (not published)"**. These contain verification flags — things that need to be checked before launch. They look like:

> VERIFY: Is "interdenominational" correct? What is the actual name of the church?

These notes are **never shown on the public website**. They're only visible here in the editor. Once you've verified or corrected the information:

1. Update the relevant content field with the correct information
2. Clear the editor note (or update it to say "Verified" / "Confirmed by Karl")
3. Save

## Writing in Markdown

The Content and Full Description fields use Markdown. The editor provides a toolbar with buttons for common formatting, but here are the basics:

```
## Section Heading

Regular paragraph text. **Bold text** and *italic text*.

- Bullet point one
- Bullet point two

[Link text](https://example.com)

**Bold label** — followed by a description.
```

The toolbar's rich text mode handles most of this for you — you can switch between rich text and raw Markdown using the toggle in the editor toolbar.

## Saving and Publishing

When you click **Publish** (or **Save**), Decap CMS creates a commit directly on the `main` branch of the GitHub repository. Cloudflare automatically rebuilds and deploys the site within a couple of minutes.

**There is no separate "staging" step.** Your changes go live after the automatic rebuild.

If you make a mistake, you can edit the entry again and correct it — the site will rebuild with your fix.

## Tips

- **Preview before publishing:** Use the preview pane on the right side of the editor to see how your content will look.
- **Don't worry about HTML:** Write in Markdown or use the rich text toolbar. The site handles all styling automatically.
- **Links:** For external sites, always include the full URL starting with `https://`. For other pages on our site, use the path (e.g., `/contact`).
- **Questions?** Contact John Shillington (john.shillington@gmail.com) for help with the editor itself, or with anything technical about how the site works. Once you're comfortable with the editor, you can update this line to point future contributors to whoever's the right contact then.
